# Grading System Improvements

This document summarizes the enhancements made to the application's grading system, addressing key areas identified in the initial review.

## 1. Traditional Grade Average Calculation Improvement

**Change:** The calculation of traditional student averages in the gradebook now accurately reflects performance only on *graded assignments*. Ungraded assignments no longer artificially deflate student scores.

**Impact:** Provides a more accurate and less misleading representation of student performance, especially at the beginning of a grading period.

## 2. Configurable Standards-Based Grade Conversion

**Change:** The conversion from a 4-point proficiency scale to a 100-point percentage scale is now **configurable**. Institutions or teachers can define custom percentage equivalents for each proficiency level.

**Impact:** Allows for pedagogical alignment between proficiency language (e.g., "Proficient") and traditional grade perception (e.g., 75% or "C"), providing greater flexibility and ensuring the final grade accurately reflects the school's grading philosophy.

## 3. Configurable Overall Grade Weighting

**Change:** The weighting between traditional and standards-based components for the final combined grade is now **configurable**. Default weights are 60% for traditional and 40% for standards-based, but these can be adjusted at the gradebook or subject level.

**Impact:** Empowers educators to tailor the grading system to their specific curriculum, grade level, or educational philosophy, emphasizing either standards mastery or traditional scores as needed.

## 4. Configurable Letter Grade Scale

**Change:** The letter grade scale, previously hardcoded, is now **configurable**. Administrators or teachers can define their own percentage ranges for each letter grade (A+, A, A-, etc.).

**Impact:** Enhances the application's adaptability, ensuring compliance with varying grading policies across different schools and districts.

## 5. Refactored Analytics and Data Correlation Logic

**Change:** The `calculateCorrelation` function has been refactored to correctly pair data for statistical correlation between traditional and standards-based grades. It now accurately associates traditional scores with the average proficiency scores for all standards linked to *that specific assignment* for each student.

**Impact:** The correlation metric displayed in the analytics tab is now meaningful and provides actionable insight into how different assessment types relate, addressing the previous issue of misleading metrics due to incorrect data pairing.
