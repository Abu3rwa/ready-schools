# Behavior Module Review & SEL Character Development Plan

## Current State

### Overview

- The behavior module tracks student behavior incidents, skills, and restorative actions.
- Teachers can log, edit, and delete behavior records for students, including date, description, skills, and restorative steps.
- The UI supports filtering by student and skill, and displays analytics (radar chart) of class skill profiles.
- Skill taxonomy is used to tag behaviors (e.g., Self-Regulation, Collaboration, Resilience).
- Reflection conferences and skill badges are integrated for deeper SEL engagement.
- The module is designed to support Social-Emotional Learning (SEL) and character trait development.

### SEL & Character Traits

- The school fosters SEL and 9 core character traits.
- Each month, homeroom classes focus on developing one trait (e.g., Respect, Responsibility, Empathy, Integrity, Perseverance, Self-Regulation, Collaboration, Courage, Gratitude).
- Teachers use the module to track growth, strengths, and areas for improvement.

### Strengths

- Flexible skill tagging and analytics for class and individual growth.
- Restorative practices and reflection support.
- Visualizations (radar chart, badges) for skill development.
- Modular design for future expansion.

### Areas to Improve

- **Monthly Trait Focus:** Add explicit support for monthly character trait themes (e.g., highlight current trait, filter/view progress by trait).
- **Student Growth Tracking:** Enable longitudinal tracking of student progress on each trait over time.
- **Classroom Activities:** Integrate lesson/activity logging for SEL and character trait development.
- **Parent Communication:** Add summary reports for parents on SEL/character growth each month.
- **Student Reflection:** Allow students to self-reflect and set goals for each trait.
- **Badge System:** Expand badge system to include character trait mastery and milestones.
- **Data Export:** Enable export of SEL/character data for school-wide analysis.

## Next Steps

1. **Monthly Trait Feature**
   - Add a trait-of-the-month selector and display in the UI.
   - Filter behavior records and analytics by current trait.
2. **Growth Tracking**
   - Implement charts/tables to show student progress on each trait across months.
   - Add teacher notes/goals for each trait per student.
3. **SEL Activity Integration**
   - Link SEL lessons/activities to behavior records and trait development.
   - Allow teachers to log SEL activities and outcomes.
4. **Parent Reports**
   - Generate monthly SEL/character trait summary emails for parents.
   - Include highlights, strengths, and next steps.
5. **Student Reflection & Goals**
   - Add student-facing reflection prompts and goal-setting for each trait.
   - Track student self-assessment and growth.
6. **Badge Expansion**
   - Create badges for trait mastery, milestones, and positive growth.
   - Display badges in student and class dashboards.
7. **Data Export & Analysis**
   - Enable export of SEL/character data for school-wide review.
   - Support admin dashboards for SEL program monitoring.

## Summary

The behavior module is a strong foundation for SEL and character trait development. By adding explicit monthly trait features, growth tracking, SEL activity integration, parent communication, student reflection, and expanded badges, the module will better support the school's mission and empower students to grow in all 9 character traits.
