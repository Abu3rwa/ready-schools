# User Guide: The Behavior Growth Module

Welcome to the new Behavior Module! I've designed this tool to shift our focus from simply tracking incidents to proactively fostering student growth, leadership, and self-awareness. This guide will walk you through the new features and the philosophy behind them.

## The Core Idea: From Compliance to Growth

The most significant change is the move away from a "Positive/Negative" and "Severity" model. Instead of just labeling behavior, we now focus on the underlying skills we want our students to develop. Every behavioral event is an opportunity to identify a skill as either a **strength** to be celebrated or an **area for growth** to be supported.

## How to Log a Behavior

The process for logging a behavior has been updated to reflect this new, skill-based approach.

1.  **Open the "Add Behavior" Dialog:** This part is the same as before.
2.  **Select Skills, Not Labels:** Instead of "Type" and "Severity," you will now use the new **Skill Picker**.
    *   **Choose a Skill:** Select one or more skills from our school's official Skill Library (e.g., "Resilience," "Collaboration," "Self-Regulation"). The skills are grouped by category to make them easier to find.
    *   **Identify as Strength or Growth:** For each skill you select, you will mark it as either:
        *   **A Strength:** Use this when a student has demonstrated a skill exceptionally well.
        *   **An Area for Growth:** Use this when a student's actions indicate an opportunity to develop a particular skill.
3.  **Document Support & Restorative Steps:** The field previously named "Action Taken" is now called **"Support & Restorative Steps."** Use this space to describe the support provided to the student or the restorative actions taken to help them learn and grow from the situation.

The behavior log itself will now display the skills associated with each entry, giving you a much richer, at-a-glance view of student progress.

## Fostering Student Agency

The new module includes powerful tools for involving students directly in their own growth.

### Reflection Conferences

After a behavior has been logged, you will see a new **"Log Reflection"** button. This opens a simple form where you can document a restorative conference with the student. It includes fields for:

*   **Student's Perspective:** A space to capture the student's thoughts and feelings about the event.
*   **Teacher's Notes:** Your summary of the conversation and next steps.

This feature is designed to give students a voice and make them active participants in the process.

### Student Growth Dashboard & Goals

Students now have their own dashboard where they can view their progress and set personal growth goals. They can select a skill they want to work on, write a goal description, and track their progress toward achieving it. This empowers students to take ownership of their development.

## New Analytics: Understanding Your Students

The analytics tab has been completely revamped to provide deeper insights into your classroom's skill development.

*   **Class Skills Profile (Radar Chart):** This new chart provides a visual snapshot of your entire class's collective strengths and most common areas for growth. It helps you identify class-wide trends and plan targeted instruction.
*   **Student Growth Over Time (Line Chart):** Zoom in on a single student and a specific skill. This chart visualizes their progress over time, helping you see the impact of your support and their efforts.

## Celebrating Success: Skill Badges

To positively reinforce progress, the system will automatically award **Skill Badges** to students. When a student consistently demonstrates strength in a particular skill over time, a badge for that skill will appear on their profile, celebrating their achievement and making growth visible and exciting.
