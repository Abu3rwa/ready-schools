*   **Header:** "🎉 Today's Amazing Achievements 🎉" (Likely a static part of the template)
*   **Achievement:** "You have upcoming work — planning ahead shows real leadership! ⏰📋" (This is a dynamic achievement based on `assignmentsDueSoon` being present, as seen in the `buildHtml` logic around lines 868-869 of `functions/src/templates/studentDailyUpdateEmail.js`)

**Stars Earned:**
*   **Content:** "🎊 ⭐⭐⭐ Incredible! You earned 3 stars today! ⭐⭐⭐" (Dynamically generated based on `overallGrade` and other factors, as seen in the `buildHtml` logic around lines 883-896 of `functions/src/templates/studentDailyUpdateEmail.js`)

**Motivation/Character Trait Quote:**

**Important Reminders:**
*   **Header:** "🔔 Important Reminders" (Likely a static part of the template)

## Summary of Dynamic Content Usage:

The emails demonstrate the use of the content library for:

*   **Greetings:** Personalized greetings using `firstName`.
*   **Section Headers:** `gradeSectionHeaders`, `assignmentSectionHeaders`, `behaviorSectionHeaders` are dynamically pulled from the content library.
*   **Visual Themes:** The overall styling (colors, gradients) is determined by the `visualThemes` in the content library.
*   **Motivational Quotes:** The `motivation()` function attempts to use character trait quotes or falls back to `motivationalQuotes` from the content library, or built-in quotes. The `[object Promise]` issue indicates a problem in rendering the asynchronous result.
*   **Achievement Badges:** The `achievementBadges()` function dynamically selects badges based on student performance and content from `achievementBadges` in the library.
*   **Character Trait Challenges:** The `todaysChallenge()` function uses `getDailyChallenge` from `characterTraitsService.js` or falls back to built-in challenges. The specific challenge varies deterministically per student.

**Key Observations:**

*   The `getPersonalizedContent` function in `functions/src/templates/studentDailyUpdateEmail.js` is effectively used for section headers and greetings, demonstrating the dynamic nature of these elements.
*   The `motivation()` function currently has a bug where it's rendering `[object Promise]` instead of the actual quote. This needs to be fixed to properly display the dynamic motivational content.
*   The "Today's Challenge" content is dynamic and varies between students, indicating the deterministic selection logic is working for built-in challenges.
