## Executive Summary

This document outlines a comprehensive plan to integrate standards-based grading into the existing assignment and grading system. The integration will allow teachers to:

1. **Dual Grading System**: Grade assignments with both traditional points-based grades AND individual standards assessments
2. **Standards Selection**: Choose specific educational standards for each assignment during creation/editing
3. **Individual Standards Grading**: Grade each selected standard separately for each student
4. **Enhanced Analytics**: View progress on individual standards across assignments and time
5. **Comprehensive Reporting**: Generate reports showing both traditional grades and standards mastery

        </Box>
      )}
    </AccordionDetails>
  </Accordion>
</Grid>
```

### 2. New Standards Selector Component

#### Create [`src/components/standards/StandardsSelector.jsx`](src/components/standards/StandardsSelector.jsx)

```javascript
// Multi-select component for choosing standards during assignment creation
const StandardsSelector = ({ 
  subject,

## Technical Implementation Details

### 1. Data Flow Architecture

```javascript
// Assignment Creation Flow
Assignment Form → Standards Selection → Mapping Creation → Assignment Save

// Grading Flow  
Grade Entry → Traditional Grade Save → Standards Grades Save → Composite Calculation

// Reporting Flow
Data Aggregation → Standards Analysis → Report Generation → Export/Display
```

### 2. State Management Strategy

```javascript
// New Context: StandardsGradingContext
const StandardsGradingContext = createContext();

export const StandardsGradingProvider = ({ children }) => {
  const [standardsMappings, setStandardsMappings] = useState({});
  const [standardsGrades, setStandardsGrades] = useState([]);
  const [gradingMode, setGradingMode] = useState('dual');
  
  // Methods for managing standards grading state
  const addStandardsGrade = async (gradeData) => { /* ... */ };
  const updateStandardsGrade = async (gradeId, updates) => { /* ... */ };
  const getStudentStandardsProgress = (studentId, standardId) => { /* ... */ };
  
  return (
    <StandardsGradingContext.Provider value={{
      standardsMappings,
      standardsGrades,
      gradingMode,
      addStandardsGrade,
      updateStandardsGrade,
      getStudentStandardsProgress
    }}>
      {children}
    </StandardsGradingContext.Provider>
  );
};
```

### 3. Performance Considerations

#### Database Optimization
- **Compound Indexes**: Create indexes on frequently queried field combinations
  - `(userId, assignmentId, standardId)` for standards grades
  - `(userId, studentId, standardId)` for student progress queries
  - `(userId, assignmentId)` for assignment mappings

#### Caching Strategy
- **Standards Mappings**: Cache assignment-standard mappings in memory
- **Student Progress**: Cache calculated progress data with TTL
- **Grade Calculations**: Memoize expensive calculations

#### Real-time Updates
- **Firestore Listeners**: Use onSnapshot for real-time grade updates
- **Optimistic Updates**: Update UI immediately, sync with server
- **Conflict Resolution**: Handle concurrent grade updates gracefully

### 4. Error Handling & Validation

```javascript
// Grade Validation
const validateStandardsGrade = (gradeData) => {
  const errors = [];
  
  if (!gradeData.proficiencyLevel || gradeData.proficiencyLevel < 1 || gradeData.proficiencyLevel > 4) {
    errors.push('Proficiency level must be between 1 and 4');
  }
  
  if (!gradeData.studentId || !gradeData.assignmentId || !gradeData.standardId) {
    errors.push('Student, assignment, and standard IDs are required');
  }
  
  return { isValid: errors.length === 0, errors };
};

// Mapping Validation
const validateStandardMapping = (mappingData) => {
  const errors = [];
  
  if (!mappingData.alignmentStrength || mappingData.alignmentStrength < 0.25 || mappingData.alignmentStrength > 1.0) {
    errors.push('Alignment strength must be between 0.25 and 1.0');
  }
  
  if (!['full', 'partial', 'supporting'].includes(mappingData.coverageType)) {
    errors.push('Coverage type must be full, partial, or supporting');
  }
  
  return { isValid: errors.length === 0, errors };
};
```

## Migration Strategy

### 1. Existing Data Compatibility
- **Backward Compatibility**: All existing assignments and grades continue to work
