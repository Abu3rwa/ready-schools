# Teacher's Guide: Behavior Tracking and Student Growth

This guide provides a comprehensive overview of the Behavior module, a tool designed to help you track student behavior, identify patterns, and foster a positive, growth-oriented classroom environment.

## Core Philosophy: From Compliance to Growth

The Behavior module is built on the idea that behavior is a skill that can be taught and developed. Instead of just logging "positive" or "negative" incidents, this tool helps you identify the specific social-emotional skills students are demonstrating or need to develop. This approach allows for more targeted support and meaningful conversations with students.

## Key Features

- **Skill-Based Logging:** Tag each observation with specific skills like "Resilience," "Collaboration," or "Self-Regulation."
- **Strength & Growth:** For each skill, you can note whether it was demonstrated as a `strength` or as an `area for growth`.
- **Behavior Log:** A real-time list of all behavior observations for your class.
- **Student Filtering:** Easily filter the log to see the behavior history for a single student.
- **Skill Filtering:** Filter the log to see all observations related to a specific skill across all students.
- **Restorative Steps:** Document the support and restorative actions taken to help students learn and grow.
- **Reflection Conferences:** A dedicated space to log conversations with students about their behavior, capturing their perspective and your notes.
- **Class Analytics:** Visualize class-wide trends with a "Class Skills Profile" to see collective strengths and areas for growth.

## How to Use the Behavior Module

### 1. Accessing the Behavior Module

Navigate to the "Behavior" section from the main sidebar. You will see two main tabs: **Behavior Log** and **Behavior Analytics**.

### 2. Logging a New Behavior Observation

1.  From the **Behavior Log** tab, click the **"Add"** button.
2.  In the dialog box that appears:
    - **Select the Student:** Choose the student from the dropdown list.
    - **Set the Date:** The current date is selected by default, but you can change it.
    - **Write a Description:** Provide a brief, objective description of what you observed.
    - **Select Skills:**
      - Use the **Skill Picker** to choose one or more skills related to the observation.
      - For each skill you select, specify whether it was a `strength` (the student demonstrated the skill effectively) or a `growth` area (the student needs support with this skill).
    - **Add Support & Restorative Steps (Optional):** Describe any actions taken, conversations had, or support provided to the student.
3.  Click **"Add Record"** to save the observation.

### 3. Viewing and Filtering the Behavior Log

- The **Behavior Log** tab displays all recent observations, with the newest at the top.
- Use the **"Student"** dropdown to view records for a specific student. Select "All Students" to see the whole class list.
- Use the **"Skill"** dropdown to filter the log for a particular skill, helping you identify patterns.

### 4. Editing or Deleting a Record

- To the right of each behavior record, you will find icons to **Edit** or **Delete** the entry.
- Clicking **Edit** will open the same dialog you used to add the record, allowing you to make changes.
- Clicking **Delete** will ask for confirmation before permanently removing the record.

### 5. Conducting a Reflection Conference

After an incident, having a restorative conversation with a student is crucial. The Reflection Conference feature helps you document these important interactions.

1.  Find the relevant behavior record in the log.
2.  Click the **Reflection Icon** (looks like a speech bubble).
3.  In the **Reflection Conference** dialog:
    - Document the **student's perspective** on the situation.
    - Add your **teacher notes** and next steps.
4.  Click **Save** to attach the reflection to the behavior record.

### 6. Using Behavior Analytics

The **Behavior Analytics** tab provides a powerful, high-level view of your classroom's social-emotional landscape. It helps you move from individual observations to whole-class insights, enabling you to be more strategic in your instruction and support.

#### Class Skills Profile (Radar Chart)

This is the centerpiece of the analytics tab. The radar chart visualizes the collective strengths and growth areas of your entire class.

- **What it Shows:** Each point on the chart represents a skill from your skills taxonomy (e.g., "Collaboration," "Resilience"). The further a point is from the center, the more frequently that skill has been logged in your observations.
- **How it's Weighted:** The chart uses a "weighted signals" system. Observations logged as a `strength` contribute more to a skill's score than those logged as a `growth` area. This ensures the chart highlights positive trends and areas of mastery.
- **How to Interpret It:**
  - **Peaks (Points far from the center):** These are your class's dominant skills. They represent collective strengths you can celebrate and leverage.
  - **Valleys (Points close to the center):** These are skills that have been observed less frequently or are more often marked as growth areas. These might be skills that require more direct instruction or opportunities for practice across the whole class.
  - **A Balanced Shape:** Over time, as you log more observations, you aim for a balanced shape, indicating that students are developing across a wide range of skills.

#### Skill Badges

This section serves as a model for how you can recognize and celebrate student progress. While the badges shown are examples, they represent the goal of the system: to provide tangible recognition for consistent effort and mastery in key social-emotional skills. This feature helps gamify positive behavior and gives students clear goals to strive for.

## Best Practices for Teachers

- **Be Objective:** In your descriptions, state what you saw and heard, avoiding subjective judgments.
- **Log Strengths, Too:** Make an effort to catch students demonstrating skills well. This provides a more balanced view and is a great tool for positive reinforcement.
- **Involve Students:** When appropriate, discuss the skills with your students. Use the language of the skills taxonomy in your conversations.
- **Look for Patterns:** Regularly review the analytics and filter by student or skill to identify trends. Is a student consistently struggling with self-regulation before lunch? Does the whole class need a refresher on collaboration during group work?
- **Connect to Instruction:** Use the data to inform your teaching. If you see a class-wide need for resilience, you might plan a lesson or read a story that models it.

By using the Behavior module consistently and thoughtfully, you can create a more supportive and data-informed classroom culture that truly fosters student growth.
