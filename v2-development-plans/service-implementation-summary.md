# Service Implementation Summary for Version 2

This document provides a comprehensive summary of the implementation plans for both frontend (`src/services`) and backend (`functions/src/services`) to support the Version 2 requirements, with detailed multi-tenancy implementation strategies.

## Overview

Version 2 of the Teacher Dashboard will transition from a single-user application to a multi-tenant SaaS platform. This requires significant changes to both the frontend and backend service layers to support:

1. **Multi-tenancy with strict data isolation** - Complete separation of data between organizations
2. **Role-based access control (RBAC)** - Granular permissions based on user roles and subscription tiers
3. **Subscription-based feature flagging** - Feature access controlled by subscription plans
4. **Enhanced security measures** - Organization boundary enforcement and data protection
5. **Improved performance and scalability** - Horizontal scaling with efficient resource usage

## Multi-Tenancy Architecture

### Core Principles
- **Data Isolation**: All data must be scoped to a specific organization
- **Context Enforcement**: Every request must include organization context
- **Boundary Validation**: Server-side validation of organization boundaries
- **Audit Trail**: Complete logging of all cross-organization access attempts

### Implementation Strategy
```javascript
// Base service class with multi-tenancy support
class BaseService {
  constructor(organizationId) {
    this.organizationId = organizationId;
    this.validateOrganizationId(organizationId);
  }
  
  validateOrganizationId(orgId) {
    if (!orgId || typeof orgId !== 'string') {
      throw new Error('Valid organization ID is required');
    }
  }
  
  // All data operations include organization context
  async getData(collection, filters = {}) {
    const query = {
      ...filters,
      organizationId: this.organizationId
    };
    
    return await this.firestore
      .collection(collection)
      .where('organizationId', '==', this.organizationId)
      .get();
  }
}
```

## Frontend Services (`src/services`)

The frontend services primarily handle client-side interactions with the backend and data management in the browser. The main improvements needed include:

### Key Areas for Improvement:

#### 1. **Multi-tenancy Support**
- **Organization Context**: All services must include organization context in data requests
- **Data Isolation**: Client-side filtering to prevent cross-organization data access
- **Context Validation**: Verify organization context before making API calls

**Implementation Example:**
```javascript
// Enhanced service with organization context
class StudentService extends BaseService {
  constructor(organizationId) {
    super(organizationId);
  }
  
  async getStudents(filters = {}) {
    // Always include organization context
    const queryFilters = {
      ...filters,
      organizationId: this.organizationId
    };
    
    try {
      const result = await this.apiClient.get('/students', { params: queryFilters });
      
      // Additional client-side validation
      const validatedStudents = result.data.filter(student => 
        student.organizationId === this.organizationId
      );
      
      return { success: true, data: validatedStudents };
    } catch (error) {
      console.error('Error fetching students:', error);
      throw new Error('Failed to fetch students');
    }
  }
}
```

#### 2. **Authentication and Authorization**
- **Multi-tenant Auth**: Support for users belonging to multiple organizations
- **Role-based Access**: Permission checking based on user roles and organization membership
- **Session Management**: Secure session handling with organization context

**Implementation Example:**
```javascript
// Multi-tenant authentication service
class MultiTenantAuthService {
  constructor() {
    this.currentOrganization = null;
    this.userOrganizations = [];
  }
  
  async login(email, password, organizationId) {
    try {
      // Authenticate with Firebase
      const userCredential = await signInWithEmailAndPassword(auth, email, password);
      
      // Verify organization membership
      const membership = await this.verifyOrganizationMembership(
        userCredential.user.uid, 
        organizationId
      );
      
      if (!membership) {
        throw new Error('User not authorized for this organization');
      }
      
      // Set current organization context
      this.currentOrganization = membership.organization;
      
      return {
        user: userCredential.user,
        organization: membership.organization,
        role: membership.role,
        permissions: membership.permissions
      };
    } catch (error) {
      console.error('Authentication error:', error);
      throw error;
    }
  }
  
  async verifyOrganizationMembership(userId, organizationId) {
    const userDoc = await getDoc(
      doc(db, `organizations/${organizationId}/users`, userId)
    );
    
    if (!userDoc.exists()) return null;
    
    const userData = userDoc.data();
    const orgDoc = await getDoc(doc(db, 'organizations', organizationId));
    
    return {
      organization: orgDoc.data(),
      role: userData.role,
      permissions: userData.permissions
    };
  }
}
```

class BackendStudentService extends BaseService {
  constructor(organizationId) {
    super(organizationId);
  }
  
  async getStudents(filters = {}) {
    // Server-side organization validation
    if (!this.organizationId) {
      throw new Error('Organization ID is required');
    }
    
    // Build query with organization context
    let query = this.firestore
      .collection('students')
      .where('organizationId', '==', this.organizationId);
    
    // Apply additional filters
    if (filters.gradeLevel) {
      query = query.where('gradeLevelId', '==', filters.gradeLevel);
    }
    
    if (filters.status) {
      query = query.where('status', '==', filters.status);
    }
    
    const snapshot = await query.get();
    return snapshot.docs.map(doc => ({
      id: doc.id,
      ...doc.data()
    }));
  }
  
  async createStudent(studentData) {
    // Validate organization context
    if (studentData.organizationId !== this.organizationId) {
      throw new Error('Organization ID mismatch');
    }
    
    // Add audit fields
    const enrichedData = {
      ...studentData,
      createdAt: admin.firestore.FieldValue.serverTimestamp(),
      createdBy: this.currentUserId,
      organizationId: this.organizationId
    };
    
    const docRef = await this.firestore
      .collection('students')
      .add(enrichedData);
    
    return { id: docRef.id, ...enrichedData };
  }
}
```
