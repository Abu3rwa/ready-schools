# Version 2 Implementation Overview

This document provides an overview of all implementation plans for Version 2 of the Teacher Dashboard, transforming it from a single-user application to a multi-tenant SaaS platform.

## Project Goals

1. Transition to a multi-tenant SaaS platform
2. Implement monetization through subscription tiers
3. Enhance security and data isolation
4. Improve performance and scalability
5. Add comprehensive feature set for educational institutions

## Implementation Plans

### 1. Service Implementation Plans

#### Frontend Services (`src/services`)
**File:** `src-services-implementation-plan.md`

Key improvements:
- Multi-tenancy support with organization context
- Enhanced authentication and authorization
- New services for email, reporting, and analytics
- Performance optimizations and caching strategies

#### Backend Services (`functions/src/services`)
**File:** `functions-services-implementation-plan.md`

Key improvements:
- Multi-tenancy support with organization context
- New domain-specific services (auth, billing, schools, users, students, classes, grades, attendance, communication, reports, integrations, daily updates, analytics)
- Enhanced security measures and rate limiting
- Performance optimizations and caching strategies

### 2. Page Implementation Plan

#### Frontend Pages (`src/pages`)
**File:** `src-pages-implementation-plan.md`

Key improvements:
- Multi-tenancy support with organization context
- New pages for organization management, user management, billing, and analytics
- Enhanced UI/UX with responsive design
- Performance optimizations with code splitting

### 3. Service Structure

#### V2 Service Structure
**File:** `v2-service-structure.md`

Defines the proposed directory structure for both frontend and backend services, organized by feature domain following the Firebase Cloud Functions architecture.

### 4. Implementation Summary

#### Service Implementation Summary
**File:** `service-implementation-summary.md`

Provides a summary of implementation plans for both frontend and backend services, including cross-cutting concerns and implementation priorities.
